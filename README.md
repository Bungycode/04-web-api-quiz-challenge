# 04-Web-Api-Quiz-Challenge

## Description 

The purpose of this program is to simulate how using JavaScript in combination with HTML and CSS can make a program become dynamic instead of just static. In this program there will be different states of html being shown and hidden. There will be use of the local storage. There will be all kinds of different aspects of javaScript being applied, including math formulas, methods, properties, and more. This program illustrates how you can take all these concepts and create a dynamic quiz game that saves statistics every time you play.
